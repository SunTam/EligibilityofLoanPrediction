# Eligibility of Loan Prediction
Eligibility of loan prediction using Decision Tree and Ensemble Methods

## Introduction
Loan eligibility prediction is the estimation of the tendency of the customer whether they are eligible to take the loan as per their status and properties.

## Problem Statement
The problem statement of loan eligibility prediction is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a loan applicant is eligible for a loan based on various factors such as income, employment history, property, salary, and other relevant financial and personal information.

## Objectives
1. To implement an algorithm to predict the customers who are eligible to take loans from financial institutions
2. To compare multiple machine learning models and choose the best model from them.
3. To provide transparency to the loan eligibility system.

## Scope
This project will be helpful to banks and other financial institutions. Financial institutions can analyze or review historical data before giving a loan to a customer. The historical data of customers will be used in order to do analysis. Later on, some analysis will also be done to find the factors that affect the prediction result the most. It can be used by e-commerce companies to offer financing options to customers for buying products.

## Dataset
The dataset is taken from Kaggle and belongs to a Hackathon organized by “Univ.AI”!! <br>  This dataset contains information regarding the people who are eligible for loans or not. <br> It includes features like income, age, profession, experience, etc. All the features are listed below.<br>
Number of instances: 280000<br>
Number of features: 11 Input Features and 1 Target Feature (Defaulted).
